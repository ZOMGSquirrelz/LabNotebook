College project to create data entry application for a laboratory setting

This project is a for my capstone course for my Software Development Degree.
At the time of writting this and creating this project, I work in a food protection lab. We are currently trying to transition to a paperless lab format, which includes creating a data entry portion of our laboratory information management system (LIMS). This project is my attempt at creating such a system.

The main language utilzed is Python with MSSQL for my database.
The GUI is being created utilizing CumstomTkinter.
